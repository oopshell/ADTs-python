# Data Structure in Python

## 1. Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)

Stacks are often implemented using Python lists where `append()` is used to push an item, and `pop()` is used to remove the top item.

## 2. Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
Queues can be implemented using Python `collections.deque` to achieve O(1) complexity for adding/removing elements from either end.

## 3. Linked List
A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.

## 4. Binary Search Tree (BST)
